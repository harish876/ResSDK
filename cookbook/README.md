# AI Agent Cookbook for ResilientDB

This cookbook demonstrates how to build intelligent AI agents using the basic ResilientDB SDK primitives:

- `createCollection()` - Define data structures
- `insert()` - Store data
- `find()` - Query by filters  
- `findById()` - Retrieve specific records

## Examples

### 1. Task Management AI Agent
A smart task manager that can:

### 3. Knowledge Base AI Agent
An intelligent knowledge manager that can:
- Store and categorize information
- Find relevant content by context
- Build knowledge graphs from relationships
- Provide intelligent search and recommendations

## Getting Started

Each example demonstrates how to build sophisticated AI agents using just the basic database primitives, showing how simple operations can be combined to create powerful, intelligent systems.
